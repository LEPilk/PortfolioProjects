# Learning and Portfolio Projects
This Repository will hold all of the code and queries from my classwork, as well as personal and portfolio projects. I'm including both because I would like to document my progress and the paths that I take while learning about data analytics, R, SQL, and Python. 

## Projects

### Google Data Analytics Capstone: BikeShare
As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone course, I had to prepare a case study that applied the data cleaning, exploration, and analysis skills taught in the course.

For this project I used R as it could do all of the mentioned work as well as data visualizations.


### Covid 19 Data Exploration Using SQL
Used SQL to explore COVID-19 deaths and vaccination rates from around the globe from Our World in Data.  

Skills Used in This Project: Joins, Aggregate Functions, and Converting Data Types


### NLP Twitter Sentiment Analysis
